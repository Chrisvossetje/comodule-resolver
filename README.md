# How to run

## Prerequisites
- npm 
- python

## Run

To build the site run:
- npm run build

To continuously build the site run:
- npm run watch

Note that this only watches changes in site/src, NOT in site/static

The site is now statically build in the folder: _site

Because of CORS reasons you need to host the site using f.e. python3 as follows:
- cd ./_site && python3 -m http.server 8080

Then go the browser and browse to:
- localhost:8080

## What actually happens
Before each tsc build we remove the whole _site folder and copy all static files to _site again.
Then we use ESBuild to bundle and compile all our typescript files into a single index.js file (possibly minified) which also gets copied to _site
